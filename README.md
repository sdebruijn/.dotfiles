# .dotfiles

1. Clone this repo in `~/.dotfiles`.
```sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Copy `.zshenv`:
```sh
cp .zshenv.example ../.zshenv
```

3. For each program call `stow <program>`:
```sh
stow zsh
stow nvim
```

## Directions
Each sub directory should contain a file tree as it would appear in $HOME.

## Stow

Consider the folder

dotfiles/
├── nvim
│   └── .config
│       └── nvim
└── zsh
    └── .zshrc


By running **stow** followed by a folder name we will create symbolic links in the 
parent folder of the current location (here, current location: ~/dotfiles, 
destination location: ~/).


So to create sym links for the config files of nvim and zsh: 

```sh
cd dotfiles
stow nvim
stow zsh
```

which will result in 
(symbolically identical)


parent/
├── .config
│   └── nvim
└── .zshrc
